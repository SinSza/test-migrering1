    # The job will be executed on runners
    # Gitlab runners -> exectutor
    # Executor determines the enviroment each job runs in
    # Shell is the simples executor, commans executed on operatin system
    # On the shell of the server, where GitLab runner is installed

    # Another common execution enviroment on GitLab is dockercontainer
    # Instead of executing the jobs directly on the operating system (ex. Linux machine)
    # Execute the job on a docker container
    # GitLab runner is installed on Linux machine ->
    # GitLab runner creates docker containers to run the job
    # GitLabs managed runners use Docker containers
    # Containers run based on a certain Docker image
    # Depending on the image you use, you have different tools available, inside the container
    # If you have a node.js image you have npm and node.js available in the container
    # By default GitLab managed runners use ruby image
    # For our job to execute Python test, we need Python not ruby, need make test available
    # Can specify the Docker image that the job should run in
